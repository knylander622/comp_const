CS 4318 Compiler Project Part 1 Write Up

Keaton Nylander & Sirr Mena

Sirr's Contributions:
Worked on filling out keywords,operators, constants, some of the regex definitions, and the updateCol and countLines functions

Keaton's Contributions:
Worked on most of the regex definitions, processString function, identifiers, and conducted most of the testing 

Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
"abc\tdef"
"x\y"

Output should be something like:
<STRING, abc	def> : (1:1)
<ERROR, Unrecognized escape character in String> : (2:4)

Test Case 2:
int x; /* comment */
int y; /* never ends

Output should be something like 
<KEYWORD, int> : (1:1)
<ID, x> : (1:5)
<PUNCTUATION, ;> : (1:6)
<KEYWORD, int> : (2:1)
<ID, y> : (2:5)
<PUNCTUATION, ;> : (2:6)
<ERROR, Unterminated comment> : (2:8)

How to Compile:
make clean; make
